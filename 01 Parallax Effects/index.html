        <h1>Parallax Effect</h1>
        <p>
          The parallax effect is an optical illusion that occurs when nearby
          objects appear to move differently from background objects due to
          changes in the viewer’s point of view.

        <p>
          Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can fly autonomously
          or be remotely controlled. They’re used for photography, surveillance,
          delivery, and even artistic shots like the parallax effect we just
          discussed!

        <p>
          Airplanes are powered flying vehicles that transport passengers and
          cargo through the sky. They’ve revolutionized global travel and
          connected us like never before!

        <h1>Virtual Reality</h1>
        <p>
          VR immerses users in a simulated environment, often using headsets.
          It’s like stepping into another world—whether for gaming, training, or
          exploration.
